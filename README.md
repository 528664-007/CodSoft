CODSOFT Data Science Internship Tasks
This repository contains my solutions for the tasks assigned during the CODSOFT Data Science Internship. Below is an overview of each task along with the datasets used and the approaches taken.

Tasks Overview
Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
Description: Build a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.

Dataset: Titanic dataset (link provided in the task description).

Approach:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data.

Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python
Description: Predict the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors using regression techniques.

Dataset: Movie rating dataset (link provided in the task description).

Approach:

Data cleaning and feature extraction.

EDA to identify correlations and trends.

Model training using regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees).

Evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.

Task 3: Iris Flower Classification
Description: Classify Iris flowers into their species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

Dataset: Iris dataset (link provided in the task description).

Approach:

Data visualization to understand feature distributions.

Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors).

Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Python
Description: Forecast product sales based on advertising expenditure, audience segmentation, and platform selection.

Dataset: Sales dataset (link provided in the task description).

Approach:

Feature engineering and normalization.

Model training using regression or time-series forecasting techniques.

Evaluation using metrics like MAE and MSE.

Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Description: Identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.

Dataset: Credit card transaction dataset (link provided in the task description).

Approach:

Handling class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.

Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).

Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score.
